1. Select a brand or company of your choice.
Nike

2. create a concept around which you would want to brand the company.
This concept would build on Nike's long-standing reputation as a company that creates 
high-performance athletic gear and footwear. By positioning itself as a brand that helps 
individuals unleash their inner athlete, Nike can appeal to a wide range of consumers who 
are looking to achieve their fitness and athletic goals.

The branding message could focus on how Nike's products and services can help individuals 
overcome obstacles and push themselves to achieve more than they ever thought possible. 
The message could also emphasize the importance of discipline, hard work, and perseverance in 
achieving success, both on and off the field of play.

In addition to emphasizing the performance benefits of Nike's products, the brand could also 
promote the idea that athletics is not just about winning or losing but about personal growth 
and self-discovery. By aligning itself with this broader message, Nike can position itself as 
a company that not only sells products but also fosters a healthy and active lifestyle.

Overall, the "Unleashing Your Inner Athlete" concept could help Nike differentiate itself 
from competitors and attract customers who are looking for more than just stylish athletic gear.
 By emphasizing the transformative power of athletics and the importance of personal growth and 
 self-discovery, Nike can tap into a deep-seated human desire for challenge and achievement.

 Create a narrative/story.
1. remember the target audience always.
2. value of the brand-impression. 
3. characters and plot if you are planning on to use them.
